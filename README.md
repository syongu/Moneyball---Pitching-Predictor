# Pitch Prediction Project

## Overview
```
This project will use machine learning methods to correctly predict the pitch type and location for hitters based on past and in-game information. By doing so, hitters will be well-prepared for the incoming pitches during at-bat and improve their hitting performance, which ultimately helps the team to win the ball game.
```

## Dataset:
```
The dataset comes from [MLB Pitch Data 2015-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018/data?select=atbats.csv). It records the every pitch information for MLB games from 2015 to 2019. A data dictionary has been added to the dataset folder.
